## ✨ Motivation

As part of my personal research into finding the **best laptops for data science and machine learning tasks** in 2025, I compiled this comparison data. These findings represent the culmination of that research. To easily share and showcase these results online, and because a simple, static file is all that was needed, leveraging **Git** and **GitHub Pages** (a common step in modern dev workflows, often involving pipelines) seemed like the most straightforward and efficient approach for free deployment. 🤔 This project became a practical way to publish my research findings while simultaneously utilizing a robust version control and hosting solution. 🚀
