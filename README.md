## ✨ Motivation

The **primary motivation** behind this project was the desire to build and deploy a simple static application for **free** online. Realizing that **Git** and **GitHub Pages** offer an ideal platform for this, the project became a practical exercise specifically focused on learning and implementing that Git-based deployment workflow. 🤔 This comparison table served as the perfect, self-contained content to achieve that goal! 🚀
